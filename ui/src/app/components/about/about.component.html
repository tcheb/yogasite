<p>Yoga philosophy found me as anxiety was wreaking havoc on my nervous system. I came from France over 20 years ago and have been practicing Yoga for 18 years, teaching it for 4. My approach reflects my thirst for inner peace, my quest for self-acceptance and my curiosity for all things energy work.</p>
<p>My intention for my classes is that students take home a lasting sense of calm. My tools are the magic of Yoga and Energy Medicine practices, including self-massage, grounding sequencing and anxiety-soothing breath work. I also aim to inspire an expansion of the breath and of the subtle body through flowing asana and pranayama, balancing between strength and flexibility.</p>
<p>In all my classes, you are encouraged to listen to your body and you are free to adapt or skip any pose that doesnâ€™t work for you. Come as you are, everyone is welcome to explore what the interplay of Yoga and Energy Medicine has to offer. I'm looking forward to seeing you in class!</p>
