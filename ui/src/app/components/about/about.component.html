<p>Sylvie, originally from France, began practicing yoga as a way to cope with persistent anxiety and freeze response. In its mindful practices and ancient teachings, she found answers and techniques that helped tremendously and convinced her to become a teacher. Through her long-term teachers Maria Williquette and Julia Canfield, both highly intuitive healers in their own right, she was seeped in a cauldron of yogic philosophy and its relationship with western psychology, as well as trauma-informed approaches. Through her teacher and mentor Lynn Jensen (Yoga for Fertility), she also began furthering her healing process thanks to the possibilities offered by Energy Medicine (Donna Eden) and Energy Medicine Yoga (Lauren Walker). Avid to learn and teach, Sylvie then became certified by Lauren Walker as an Energy Medicine Yoga® foundations teacher. She is now pursuing continuing education with Dianne Bondy and Amber Karnes through the Yoga for All training program, so as to make her yoga classes more accessible to different body types.</p>
<p>Sylvie’s classes are a blend of all these influences. You might hear an occasional poem for inspiration, use hand mudras for concentration, and trace energy lines on your body while you move through gentle and adaptable flows. Her intention is to help guide the thinking mind to rest for the wisdom of the body to emerge.</p>
<p>Sylvie is awesome!</p>
